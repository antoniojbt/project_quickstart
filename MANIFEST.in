# By default, Distutils (the packaging framework, called in setup.py) will include the following files in your release package:
#    README.txt
#    setup.py
#    The .py files needed by the multi-file modules listed in the packages parameter
#    The individual .py files listed in the py_modules parameter 

# MANIFEST.in commands:
# https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/sourcedist.html#commands

# See explanation in: http://www.diveintopython3.net/packaging.html
# Use .add_data_files and .add_data_dir methods in appropriate
# setup.py files to include non-python files such as documentation,
# data, etc files to distribution. Avoid using MANIFEST.in for that.

# Use check-manifest to detect errors in setup.py:
# https://pypi.python.org/pypi/check-manifest

# Except packaging in Python is a massive pain with incomplete and seemingly
# contradicting docs.
